- This project was part of a front-end design workshop in school, which I worked on and presented in front of the class alongside a classmate.

- Disclaimer: The app name "Strava" is already owned by another company. We used it purely as a prototype name because we liked its logo design and color scheme. We do not own the name, and this is for demonstration purposes only.
