# Port Scanner
## Description
- This script is a simple port scanner that allows you to specify a target IP address and checks the status of its ports. It sends TCP packets to the specified ports and, based on the response, determines whether the port is open or closed.

## Features
- Scan a range of ports on a given IP address.
- Check if each port is open or closed based on the response from the target.
## Usage
- Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine.
- Specify the target IP address and the port(s) you want to scan in the script.
- Run the script to see which ports are open or closed.
# Dependencies
- Python 3.13
- socket, pyfiglet, sys, datetime
